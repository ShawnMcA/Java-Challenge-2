# Java-Challenge-2
This program was a challenge for my Java class. The goal was to create a student registrar program
that would accept a student first name, last name, and enrollment date, and output their expected 
graduation date using GregorianCalendar as a format. As a requirement, we were expected to create two 
Student test objects from a College Student class.
